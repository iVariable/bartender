Bananas suck, they get gushy, watermellon works ok but the seeds get to be a pain in the ass when you can't see so well, pineapple is good, basically you get the point.

This is why your pot has to be bigger: the frothing would cause a major spill if you used a smaller pot. Serve and drink while hot. You can also adjust sweetness in your cup. Some people may want to strain this, as the ground spices sometimes have some coarse particles. This is a very nice hot drink, with a definite indian-food flavour, spicy-sweet and rich.
